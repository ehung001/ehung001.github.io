The Paya Lebar Airport was regarded as a symbol of the then-colony’s post-war rapid development and modernisation. The airport's expansions and renovations reflected the exponential growth in air travel in the 1950s and 1960s. Many visitors had fond memories of the arrival hall built in the Modern style, with high ceilings and thick pillars clad in black marble and gold mosaic. The rooftop viewing gallery was also popular with visitors, and included a restaurant decorated with a mosaic mural depicting local life. The airport ceased operations as a civilian airport in 1981 with the opening of Changi International Airport. </h5> </p>

                        <h6> On 20 August 1955, the Paya Lebar International Airport was officially opened by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd. It replaced the Kallang International Airport as Singapore’s main commercial airport. This led to a rapid expansion of air travel in the 1960s and 1970s. Extensions for the airport were built in response to the increase in the volume of passenger traffic. However, in 1971 and 1978, the airport was unable to cope with the high capacity. Changi Airport would eventually become the plan for a new commercial airport in 1981. </h6>

                        <h6> The consolidation and reclamation of the land was completed in mid-1936, and construction for the airport buildings started. On 12 June 1937, the new airport was officially announced open by the Governor of Singapore, Sir Shenton Tomas. Planes were brought over the waterfront via the air corridor to Kallang. </h6>

Visitor arrivals to Singapore hit 100,000. The photograph displays what is referred to today as the ‘mushroom counter’. </h6>
